I am a research student in Secure Systems at the University of Surrey. My PhD is
under the supervision of Helen Treharne and Steve Schneider, and is supported by
the EPSRC and Thales UK. As part of the PhD I complete a placement at Thales
UK Research and Technology in Reading, and Thales eSecurity in Cambridge.

My current research interests are mainly in the formal verification of security
protocols, with a focus on how to model "Trusted Computing" symbolically.
Additionally, I am also working on how to model Zero-knowledge proofs in the
symbolic setting.
