I am a research student in Secure Systems at the [University of Surrey](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/).
My PhD is under the supervision of [Helen Treharne](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/cs/people/helen_treharne/)
and [Steve Schneider](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/cs/people/steve_schneider/), and is supported by the
[EPSRC](https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/) and [Thales UK](https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/countries/europe/united-kingdom).
As part of the PhD I complete a placement at Thales UK Research and Technology in Reading, and Thales
eSecurity in Cambridge.

My current research interests are mainly in the formal verification of security
protocols, with a focus on how to model "*Trusted Computing*" symbolically.
Additionally, I am also working on how to model *Zero-knowledge proofs* in the
symbolic setting.
